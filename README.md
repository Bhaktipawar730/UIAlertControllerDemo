# UIAlertControllerDemo

SimpleAlertApp is an iOS application built using Swift and UIKit. This project demonstrates how to create and present a `UIAlertController` with multiple actions and text fields.

## Key Features:

- **UIAlertController Creation:**  
  Displays a simple alert with a title ("Simple Alert") and a message ("Do you want to Submit?").

- **Text Fields:**  
  The alert includes two text fields for user input:  
  - **Name**: Placeholder set to "Enter Name".  
  - **Password**: Placeholder set to "Enter Password".

- **Action Buttons:**  
  The alert contains three action buttons:  
  - **Submit**: Logs "Submit button tapped" to the console when pressed.  
  - **Cancel**: Logs "Cancel button tapped" to the console when pressed.  
  - **Delete**: Logs "Delete button tapped" to the console when pressed.

- **User Interaction:**  
  Demonstrates how to handle user actions and execute specific code based on the button tapped.

## Use of UIAlertController:

`UIAlertController` is used to present alerts and action sheets in iOS applications. It simplifies capturing user inputs, confirming actions, or providing critical information. This project highlights how to:
- Add text fields to capture user input.
- Use different styles for action buttons (`default`, `cancel`, and `destructive`).
- Present alerts dynamically in response to user interactions.
